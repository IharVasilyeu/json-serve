# Main Info 
When doing requests, it's good to know that:

- If you make POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests, changes will be automatically and safely saved to `db.json` using [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).
- Your request body JSON should be object enclosed, just like the GET output. (for example `{"name": "Foobar"}`)
- Id values are not mutable. Any `id` value in the body of your PUT or PATCH request will be ignored. Only a value set in a POST request will be respected, but only if not already taken.
- A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a `Content-Type: application/json` header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will return a 2XX status code, but without changes being made to the data. 

## Entities

- Users - [/users](/users)

- Disputes - [/disputes](/disputes)

## Routes

Based on the previous `db.json` file, here are all the default routes. You can also add [other routes](#add-custom-routes) using `--routes`.

### Plural routes

```
GET    /posts
GET    /posts/1
POST   /posts
PUT    /posts/1
PATCH  /posts/1
DELETE /posts/1
```

### Singular routes

```
GET    /profile
POST   /profile
PUT    /profile
PATCH  /profile
```

### Filter

Use `.` to access deep properties

```
GET /posts?title=json-server&author=typicode
GET /posts?id=1&id=2
GET /comments?author.name=typicode
```

### Paginate

Use `_page` and optionally `_limit` to paginate returned data.

In the `Link` header you'll get `first`, `prev`, `next` and `last` links.


```
GET /posts?_page=7
GET /posts?_page=7&_limit=20
```

_10 items are returned by default_

### Sort

Add `_sort` and `_order` (ascending order by default)

```
GET /posts?_sort=views&_order=asc
GET /posts/1/comments?_sort=votes&_order=asc
```

For multiple fields, use the following format:

```
GET /posts?_sort=user,views&_order=desc,asc
```

### Slice

Add `_start` and `_end` or `_limit` (an `X-Total-Count` header is included in the response)

```
GET /posts?_start=20&_end=30
GET /posts/1/comments?_start=20&_end=30
GET /posts/1/comments?_start=20&_limit=10
```

_Works exactly as [Array.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) (i.e. `_start` is inclusive and `_end` exclusive)_

### Operators

Add `_gte` or `_lte` for getting a range

```
GET /posts?views_gte=10&views_lte=20
```

Add `_ne` to exclude a value

```
GET /posts?id_ne=1
```

Add `_like` to filter (RegExp supported)

```
GET /posts?title_like=server
```

### Full-text search

Add `q`

```
GET /posts?q=internet
```

### Relationships

To include children resources, add `_embed`

```
GET /posts?_embed=comments
GET /posts/1?_embed=comments
```

To include parent resource, add `_expand`

```
GET /comments?_expand=post
GET /comments/1?_expand=post
```

To get or create nested resources (by default one level, [add custom routes](#add-custom-routes) for more)

```
GET  /posts/1/comments
POST /posts/1/comments
```

### Database

```
GET /db
```

### Homepage

Returns default index file or serves `./public` directory

```
GET /
```
